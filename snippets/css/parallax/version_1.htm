        <p>she whispered softly, her warm breath making tiny clouds in the cold air.</p>
        <p>“Yes.” The wind was howling, shaking the trees so violently he wondered if one would eventually fall over.</p>
        <p>“Why can't I see the moon?”</p>
        <p>He looked up, unable to look her in her eyes. Not that it would have made a difference.</p>
        <p>“When it is time you will see it.” He slowly looked down at her again. Her dress was almost completely red now. He felt them pressing behind his eyes, but he kept them back. There is still time, you can’t give in yet. </p>

        <p>Her voice was surprisingly calm, and he almost wondered if she even was aware.</p>
        <p>“Yes.” He looked up towards the sky. “I see the moon.”</p>
        <p>“I like the moon.” He could see the corners of her mouth twitch, as if it wanted to move but lacked the strength.</p>
        <p>“I like the moon too” he answered as his vision clouded up. Not yet. “Your mother also likes the moon.” He stroked her head softly like he always used to do when she was younger. Her skin was soft and pale, it almost shone in the moonlight.</p>
        <p>“Is mom at the moon?”</p>
        <p>“Yes.” He looked into her deep blue eyes, the eyes she had gotten from her mother. He still remembered the first time he met her; she had looked so lovely in the moonlight. He also remembered how the moonlight embraced her he lost her. </p>

        <p>Her voice was faint now.</p>
        <p>“Yes.” He reassured her, while softly caressing her face.</p>
        <p>“I can't see the moon.” He could not tell if she was worried or not. Her face looked more and more expressionless for every minute that passed by.</p>
        <p>“You will see it soon.” It was considerably more difficult to hold them back now. Just a little longer. He knew he could not give in yet. He had to stay strong, for her. </p>

        <p>The air had gotten colder. He did not know for how long they had been there. The wind was blowing even more violently than before, yet he did not pay it any mind. He looked at her pale skin. It had gotten paler. <br>
        “I see it! I see the moon!” she exclaimed suddenly, though so faintly he almost did not hear it. She lifted her arm slowly, using all the strength she had left as if she was reaching for someone important. He grabbed her little hand, firmly. This little hand he had held so many times before felt so cold in his grasp tonight. He knew it was time. <br>
        “Go”, he said, trying his best to not let his voice crack, “your mother is waiting for you.”
        “Dad?” she whispered so weakly it was almost inaudible. “Do you see the moon?”
        The wind had stopped howling, the only sound left was his own breath. As he looked up at the cloudy night sky, he finally let them stream down his cheeks. “No” he whispered to himself, as the rain started to fall.</p>
